title: appPurchaseOneTimeCreate - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  Creates a one-time charge for app features or services that don't require

  recurring billing. This mutation is ideal for apps that sell individual

  features, premium content, or services on a per-use basis rather than

  subscription models.


  For example, a design app might charge merchants once for premium templates,

  or a marketing app could bill for individual campaign setups without ongoing
  monthly fees.


  Use the `AppPurchaseOneTimeCreate` mutation to:

  - Charge for premium features or content purchases

  - Bill for professional services or setup fees

  - Generate revenue from one-time digital product sales


  The mutation returns a confirmation URL that merchants must visit to approve

  the charge. Test and development stores are not charged, allowing safe testing

  of billing flows.

  page](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/launch/billing/support-one-time-purchases).
