title: discountCodeDelete - GraphQL Admin
description: |-
  Removes a code discount from the store, making it permanently unavailable for
  customer use. This mutation provides a clean way to eliminate discount codes
  that are no longer needed or have been replaced.

  For example, when a seasonal promotion ends or a discount code has been
  compromised, merchants can delete it entirely rather than just deactivating
  it, ensuring customers cannot attempt to use expired promotional codes.

  Use `DiscountCodeDelete` to:
  - persistently remove outdated promotional codes
  - Clean up discount code lists after campaigns end
  - Eliminate compromised or leaked discount codes
  - Maintain organized discount management

  Once deleted, the discount code cannot be recovered and any customer attempts
  to use it will fail. This differs from deactivation, which preserves the code
  for potential future reactivation.
