title: commentNotSpam - GraphQL Admin
description: |-
  Reverses a spam classification on a comment, restoring it to normal moderation
  status. This mutation allows merchants to change their decision when a comment
  has been manually marked as spam.

  For example, when a merchant reviews comments marked as spam and finds a
  legitimate customer question, they can use this mutation to restore the
  comment's normal status and make it eligible for approval.

  Use the `commentNotSpam` mutation to:
  - Unmark comments that were marked as spam
  - Restore comments to normal moderation status
  - Move comments back to the approval queue

  This action changes the comment's status from spam back to pending, where it
  can then be approved or managed according to standard moderation practices.
