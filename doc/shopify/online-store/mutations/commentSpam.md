title: commentSpam - GraphQL Admin
description: |-
  Marks a comment as spam, removing it from public view. This mutation enables
  merchants to quickly handle unwanted promotional content, malicious links, or
  other spam that appears in blog discussions.

  For example, when a comment contains suspicious links to unrelated products or
  services, merchants can mark it as spam to immediately hide it from customers.

  Use the `commentSpam` mutation to:
  - Hide promotional or malicious comments from public view
  - Protect customers from potentially harmful links
  - Maintain professional discussion quality on blog articles

  Spam-marked comments can be reviewed later and potentially restored using the
  `commentNotSpam` mutation if they were incorrectly classified.
