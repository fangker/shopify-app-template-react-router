  Use the `orderCancel` mutation to programmatically cancel orders in scenarios
  such as:


  - Customer-requested cancellations due to size, color, or other preference
  changes

  - Payment processing failures or declined transactions

  - Fraud detection and prevention

  - Insufficient inventory availability

  - Staff errors in order processing

  - Wholesale or B2B order management workflows


  The `orderCancel` mutation provides flexible refund options including
  refunding to original payment methods

  or issuing store credit. If a payment was only authorized (temporarily held)
  but not yet charged,

  that hold will be automatically released when the order is cancelled, even if
  you choose not to refund other payments.


  The mutation supports different cancellation reasons: customer requests,
  payment declines, fraud,

  inventory issues, staff errors, or other unspecified reasons. Each
  cancellation can include optional

  staff notes for internal documentation (notes aren't visible to customers).


  An order can only be cancelled if it meets the following criteria:


  - The order hasn't already been cancelled.

  - The order has no pending payment authorizations.

  - The order has no active returns in progress.

  - The order has no outstanding fulfillments that can't be cancelled.


  Orders might be assigned to locations that become

  [deactivated](https://help.shopify.com/manual/fulfillment/setup/locations-management#deactivate-and-reactivate-locations)

  after the order was created. When cancelling such orders, inventory behavior
  depends on payment status:


  - **Paid orders**: Cancellation will fail with an error if restocking is
  enabled, since inventory

  can't be returned to deactivated locations.

  - **Unpaid orders**: Cancellation succeeds but inventory is not restocked
  anywhere, even when the

  restock option is enabled. The committed inventory effectively becomes
  unavailable rather than being

  returned to stock at the deactivated location.


  After you cancel an order, you can still make limited updates to certain
  fields (like

  notes and tags) using the

  [`orderUpdate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/orderUpdate).


  For partial refunds or more complex refund scenarios on active orders,

  such as refunding only specific line items while keeping the rest of the order
  fulfilled,

  consider using the
  [`refundCreate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/refundCreate)

  mutation instead of full order cancellation.

* ### Cancel an order and refund to store credit

  #### Description

  Cancel an \[order]\(https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order) and refund the payment to the customer's store credit account. The mutation creates store credit with an expiration date and maintains the refundable amount for future use. This example demonstrates the alternative refund method for providing customer value without processing traditional refunds.

* ### Cancel an order without refunding

  #### Description

  Cancel an \[order]\(https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order) without refunding the customer while still voiding authorized payments. The mutation cancels the order and restocks inventory but maintains the refundable amount, allowing for manual refund processing later. This example demonstrates order cancellation without automatic customer refunds.

  #### Query

  ```graphql
  mutation OrderCancel($orderId: ID!, $refundMethod: OrderCancelRefundMethodInput!, $restock: Boolean!, $reason: OrderCancelReason!) {
