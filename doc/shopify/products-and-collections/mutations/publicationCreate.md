title: publicationCreate - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  Creates a
  [`Publication`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Publication)
  that controls which

  [`Product`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product)
  and
  [`Collection`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Collection)

  customers can access through a
  [`Catalog`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/interfaces/Catalog).


  ### When to create a publication


  Publications are **optional** for catalogs. Only create a publication if you

  need to control which products are visible in a specific catalog context. When

  a publication isn't associated with a catalog, product availability is

  determined by the sales channel.


  **Create a publication if you need to:**

  - Restrict product visibility to a subset of your inventory for a specific
  market or company location

  - Publish different product selections to different contexts


  **Do NOT create a publication if:**

  - You want product availability determined by the sales channel

  - You only need custom pricing (use a price list on the catalog instead)


  ### Configuration options


  You can create an empty publication and add products later, or prepopulate it

  with all existing products. The
  [`autoPublish`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/publicationCreate#arguments-input.fields.autoPublish)

  field determines whether the publication automatically adds newly created
  products.
