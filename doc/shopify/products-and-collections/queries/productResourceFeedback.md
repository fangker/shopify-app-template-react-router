title: productResourceFeedback - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  Retrieves product resource feedback for the currently authenticated app,

  providing insights into product data quality, completeness, and optimization

  opportunities. This feedback helps apps guide merchants toward better product

  listings and improved store performance.


  For example, an SEO app might receive feedback indicating that certain

  products lack meta descriptions or have suboptimal titles, enabling the app to

  provide specific recommendations for improving search visibility and

  conversion rates.


  Use `ProductResourceFeedback` to:

  - Display product optimization recommendations to merchants

  - Identify data quality issues across product catalogs

  - Build product improvement workflows and guided experiences

  - Track progress on product listing completeness and quality

  - Implement automated product auditing and scoring systems

  - Generate reports on catalog health and optimization opportunities

  - Provide contextual suggestions within product editing interfaces


  The feedback system evaluates products against various criteria including SEO

  best practices, required fields, media quality, and sales channel

  requirements. Each feedback item includes specific details about the issue,

  suggested improvements, and priority levels.


  Feedback is app-specific and reflects the particular focus of your application

  - marketing apps receive different insights than inventory management apps.

  The system continuously updates as merchants make changes, providing real-time

  guidance for product optimization.


  This resource is particularly valuable for apps that help merchants improve

  their product listings, optimize for search engines, or enhance their overall

  catalog quality. The feedback enables proactive suggestions rather than

  reactive problem-solving.
