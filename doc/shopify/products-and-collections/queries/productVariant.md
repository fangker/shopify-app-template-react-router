  Retrieves a [product
  variant](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant)

  that comes in more than

  one
  [option](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductOption),

  t-shirt would be another.

  - Access essential product variant data (for example, title, price, image, and
  metafields).

  - Build product detail pages and manage inventory.

  - Handle international sales with localized pricing and content.

  - Manage product variants that are part of a bundle or selling plan.

* Product​Variant

  [Product​Variant](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant)

  The `ProductVariant` object represents a version of a [product](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product) that comes in more than one [option](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductOption), such as size or color. For example, if a merchant sells t-shirts with options for size and color, then a small, blue t-shirt would be one product variant and a large, blue t-shirt would be another.

  Use the `ProductVariant` object to manage the full lifecycle and configuration of a product's variants. Common use cases for using the `ProductVariant` object include:

  * Tracking inventory for each variant
  * Setting unique prices for each variant
  * Assigning barcodes and SKUs to connect variants to fulfillment services
  * Attaching variant-specific images and media
  * Setting delivery and tax requirements
  * Supporting product bundles, subscriptions, and selling plans

  A `ProductVariant` is associated with a parent [`Product`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product) object. `ProductVariant` serves as the central link between a product's merchandising configuration, inventory, pricing, fulfillment, and sales channels within the GraphQL Admin API schema. Each variant can reference other GraphQL types such as:

  * [`InventoryItem`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/InventoryItem): Used for inventory tracking
  * [`Image`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Image): Used for variant-specific images
  * [`SellingPlanGroup`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/SellingPlanGroup): Used for subscriptions and selling plans

Online store channel filtering: - `online_store_channel`: Returns all resources in the online store channel, regardless of publication status. - `published`/`visible`: Returns resources that are published to the online store. - `unpublished`: Returns resources that are not published to the online store. Channel-specific filtering using a channel ID, channel handle, [channel `app` ID](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Channel#app-price) (`Channel.app.id`), or app handle with suffixes: - `{id_or_handle}-published`: Returns resources published to the specified channel. - `{id_or_handle}-visible`: Same as `{id_or_handle}-published` (kept for backwards compatibility). - `{id_or_handle}-intended`: Returns resources added to the channel but not yet published. - `{id_or_handle}-hidden`: Returns resources not added to the channel or not published. Other: - `unavailable`: Returns resources not published to any channel.
